# One Machine against Infinite Bus (OMIB) simulation with [PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl)

# **Originally Contributed by**: Rodrigo Henriquez and José Daniel Lara

# # Introduction

# This tutorial will introduce you to the functionality of `PowerSimulationsDynamics`
# for running power system dynamic simulations.

# This tutorial presents a simulation of a two-bus system with an infinite bus
# (represented as a voltage source behind an impedance) at bus 1, and a classic
# machine on bus 2. The perturbation will be the trip of one of the two circuits
# (doubling its resistance and impedance) of the line that connects both buses.

# `PowerSystems` (abbreviated with `PSY`) is used to properly define the data structure and establish an equilibrium
# point initial condition with a power flow routine, while `Sundials` is
# used to solve the problem defined in `PowerSimulationsDynamics`.

# ## Load the system
# _The following command requires that you have executed the
# [dynamic systems data example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NREL-SIIP/SIIPExamples.jl/blob/master/notebook/2_PowerSystems_examples/09_loading_dynamic_systems_data.ipynb)
# previously to generate the json file._
file_dir = joinpath(
    dirname(dirname(pathof(SIIPExamples))),
    "script",
    "4_PowerSimulationsDynamics_examples",
    "Data",
)
omib_sys = System(joinpath(file_dir, "omib_sys.json"))

# ## Build the simulation and initialize the problem

# The next step is to create the simulation structure. This will create the indexing
# of our system that will be used to formulate the differential-algebraic system of
# equations. To do so, it is required to specify the perturbation that will occur in
# the system. `PowerSimulationsDynamics` supports three types of perturbations:

# - Network Switch: Change in the Y-bus values.
# - Branch Trip: Disconnects a line from the system.
# - Change in Reference Parameter

# Here, we will use a Branch Trip perturbation, that is modeled by modifying the
# specifying which line we want to trip. In this case we disconnect one of the lines
# that connects BUS 1 and BUS 2, named "BUS 1-BUS 2-i_1".

# With this, we are ready to create our simulation structure:
time_span = (0.0, 30.0)
perturbation_trip = BranchTrip(1.0, "BUS 1-BUS 2-i_1")
sim = PSID.Simulation(PSID.ImplicitModel, omib_sys, pwd(), time_span, perturbation_trip)

# This will automatically initialize the system by running a power flow
# and update `V_ref`, `P_ref` and hence `eq_p` (the internal voltage) to match the
# solution of the power flow. It will also initialize the states in the equilibrium,
# which can be printed with:
print_device_states(sim)

# To examine the calculated initial conditions, we can export them into a dictionary:
x0_init = PSID.get_initial_conditions(sim)

# ## Run the Simulation

# Finally, to run the simulation we simply use:
PSID.execute!(
    sim, #simulation structure
    IDA(), #Sundials DAE Solver
    dtmax = 0.02,
); #Arguments: Maximum timestep allowed

# In some cases, the dynamic time step used for the simulation may fail. In such case, the
# keyword argument `dtmax` can be used to limit the maximum time step allowed for the simulation.

# ## Exploring the solution

# `PowerSimulationsDynamics` has two functions to obtain different
# states of the solution:
#  - `get_state_series(sim, ("generator-102-1", :δ))`: can be used to obtain the solution as
# a tuple of time and the required state. In this case, we are obtaining the rotor angle `:δ`
# of the generator named `"generator-102-1"`.

angle = get_state_series(sim, ("generator-102-1", :δ));
Plots.plot(angle, xlabel = "time", ylabel = "rotor angle [rad]", label = "rotor angle")

# - `get_voltagemag_series(sim, 102)`: can be used to obtain the voltage magnitude as a
# tuple of time and voltage. In this case, we are obtaining the voltage magnitude at bus 102
# (where the generator is located).

volt = get_voltage_magnitude_series(sim, 102);
Plots.plot(volt, xlabel = "time", ylabel = "Voltage [pu]", label = "V_2")

# ## Optional: Small Signal Analysis

# `PowerSimulationsDynamics` uses automatic differentiation to compute the reduced Jacobian
# of the system for the differential states. This can be used to analyze the local stability
# of the linearized system. We need to re-initialize our simulation:

sim2 = PSID.Simulation(PSID.ImplicitModel, omib_sys, pwd(), time_span, perturbation_trip)

small_sig = small_signal_analysis(sim2)

# The `small_sig` result can report the reduced jacobian for ``\delta`` and ``\omega``,

small_sig.reduced_jacobian

# and can also be used to report the eigenvalues of the reduced linearized system:

small_sig.eigenvalues
